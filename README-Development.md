## Installation

### Standard Emacs Configuration

```elisp
;; Kawa Code Configuration
(let ((code-awareness-path "/path/to/ca.emacs/"))
  (when (file-exists-p code-awareness-path)
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "src/elisp" code-awareness-path))
    (require 'code-awareness)
    (message "Kawa Code loaded successfully")))
```

### Spacemacs Configuration

Add to your `~/.spacemacs` file in the `dotspacemacs/user-config` section:

```elisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  ;; Kawa Code Configuration
  (let ((code-awareness-path "/path/to/ca.emacs/"))
    (when (file-exists-p code-awareness-path)
      (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "src/elisp" code-awareness-path))
      (require 'code-awareness)
      (message "Kawa Code loaded successfully"))))
```

### Loading Compiled Version

For optimal performance, compile the package first:

```bash
cd /path/to/ca.emacs
make compile
```

Emacs automatically loads the compiled `.elc` files when available.

## Configuration

### Basic Settings

```elisp
;; Catalog file name (default: "catalog")
(setq code-awareness-catalog "my-catalog")

;; Update delay in seconds (default: 0.5)
(setq code-awareness-update-delay 0.5)

;; Enable debug mode (default: nil)
(setq code-awareness-debug t)
```

### Theme Colors

```elisp
;; Change colors for different themes
(setq code-awareness-change-color-light "#00b1a420")
(setq code-awareness-change-color-dark "#03445f")
(setq code-awareness-peer-color-light "#ffdd34")
(setq code-awareness-peer-color-dark "#1f1cc2")
(setq code-awareness-merge-color-light "#ffc000")
(setq code-awareness-merge-color-dark "#141299")
```

## Usage

### Commands

- `M-x code-awareness-mode` - Toggle Kawa Code mode
- `M-x code-awareness-refresh` - Refresh Kawa Code data
- `M-x code-awareness-clear-all-highlights` - Clear highlights from all buffers
- `M-x code-awareness-auth-status` - Show authentication status
- `M-x code-awareness-connection-status` - Show connection status
- `M-x code-awareness-show-log-buffer` - Show the log buffer
- `M-x code-awareness-clear-log-buffer` - Clears the log buffer

## Architecture

### IPC Communication

The package uses the same IPC protocol as the VS Code extension:

1. **Catalog Connection**: Connects to the catalog service to register the client
2. **Main IPC Connection**: Establishes the main communication channel
3. **Message Protocol**: Uses JSON messages with flow/domain/action structure
4. **Response Handling**: Hash table-based response handler system with automatic cleanup

### Highlighting System

**Dual Architecture for Maximum Compatibility:**
- **Custom Overlay System**: Traditional Emacs overlays for maximum compatibility
- **HL-Line Integration**: Modern hl-line mode support for better empty line handling
- **Automatic Selection**: Chooses the best system based on configuration and features

**Highlight Types:**
- **Conflict**: Red highlighting for merge conflicts
- **Overlap**: Orange highlighting for overlapping changes
- **Peer**: Blue highlighting for peer modifications
- **Modified**: Green highlighting for local changes

### Buffer Management

- **Active Buffer Tracking**: Monitors the currently active buffer
- **File Change Detection**: Hooks into `after-save-hook` and `post-command-hook`
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive updates with configurable delays
- **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: Proper path normalization for different OS

## Development

### Compilation

The package now compiles cleanly with no warnings:

```bash
make compile    # Compile the package
make clean      # Remove compiled files
make lint       # Compile then clean (for CI/CD)
```

### Code Quality

- **No Compilation Warnings**: All Emacs Lisp best practices followed
- **Proper Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms and data structures
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation for all functions

### Testing

The package includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
make test       # Run the test suite
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Check if Kawa Code application is running**:
   ```bash
   # Check if the catalog socket exists
   ls -la ~/.kawa-code/sockets/caw.catalog
   ```

2. **Enable debug mode**:
   ```elisp
   (setq code-awareness-debug t)
   ```

3. **View logs**:
   ```elisp
   M-x code-awareness-show-log-buffer
   ```

### Common Issues

- **"Connection failed"**: Kawa Code application not running
- **"Unknown message format"**: Protocol mismatch with Kawa Code application
- **"Socket error"**: Permission issues with socket files
- **Highlights not appearing**: Check if `code-awareness-mode` is enabled

## Future Enhancements

While the core functionality is complete, potential future improvements include:

- **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimization for large files
- **Customization Options**: More theme and behavior customization
- **Extensibility Options**: Build your own Kawa Code extensions

## License

This package is licensed under the GPLv3. 
It requires the Kawa Code binary (proprietary, licensed separately) to function fully.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The codebase follows strict quality standards:

- **No Compilation Warnings**: All code must compile cleanly
- **Comprehensive Testing**: New features must include tests
- **Documentation**: All functions must be documented
- **Code Style**: Follow Emacs Lisp best practices

## Acknowledgments

This implementation builds upon the excellent work of the the Emacs community, providing a robust and feature-complete collaboration tool for Emacs users.
